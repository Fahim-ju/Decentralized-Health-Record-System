# Healthcare DApp 

## Description
The promise of blockchain has widespread implications for stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. Capitalizing on this technology has the potential to connect fragmented systems to generate insights and to better assess the value of care. In the long term, a nationwide blockchain network for electronic medical records may improve efficiencies and support better health outcomes for patients.

1. Distributed framework for patient digital identities, which uses private and public blockchains secured through cryptography, creates a singular, more secure method of protecting patient identity. 

2. Each patients data like previous medical reports , information about major diseases and allergies will be stored in these blockchains. 

3. Smart contracts create a consistent, rule-based method for accessing patient data that can be permissioned to selected health organizations.

4. Insurance companies will define their conditions for getting accepted and the points not covered by the company . Depending on these conditions and relating those with the patients data insurance will be accepted or rejected .

## Functions
1. Four entities can sign up in our Healthcare DApp - Patient, Doctor, Insurance-Company, Chemist

2. The Complete data of a patient is linked to his/her Aadhar Card. 

3. The previous records of the Patient cannot be viewed without his/her approval, Only Doctors can view the Patient's basic Medical Info in case of emergency.

## Technology stack / technology used ( Very Detailed )
1. Solidity - To Build The Blockchain.

2. Truffle - To migrate contracts on host.

3. ReactJS - To build the Front-End.

4. Web3 - To connect Solidity to User Interface.

5. MetaMask - To allow users to run Ethereum DApp in the browser.

languages, frameworks, libraries etc. with their need & purpose

## Limitations
There should be a Authority who gives access rights to users

## Future Aspects
1. For Storing larger data files, we will use off-chain data storing on cloud servers using encryption, whose key will be stored in the blockchain and will be unique.

2. For Governments of various countries, this DApp will create direct passage between the true beneficiaries and Government. This will in turn result in good utilization of resources.
